# Dataset configuration
# ---------------------
# NPLinker supports two basic methods for loading datasets:
# 
#   1. All files stored locally
#   2. Some/all files retrieved from the paired omics platform (http://pairedomicsdata.bioinformatics.nl/)
#
# The method you want to use determines the values that should be populated in 
# the [dataset] section below. If working with a purely local dataset, NPLinker
# defaults to looking for all the necessary files in a single directory, given
# by the "root" parameter. 
#
# Alternatively, to load metabolomics data from the paired platform, set the "root"
# parameter to "platform:<projectID>", where "<projectID>" is taken from the platform 
# project list. For example, "platform:MSV000079284" would select the dataset with
# the ID MSV000079284.
#
# For more details see below. 
#
# 1. Loading local datasets
# -------------------------
# Generally speaking the dataset layout the application expects matches the structure
# of the output from a GNPS job. Workflows that are known to work so far are:
# 
#  - METABOLOMICS-SNETS (version 1.2.3) 
#  - METABOLOMICS-SNETS-V2 (version release_14) 
#  - FEATURE-BASED-MOLECULAR-NETWORKING (version 1.2.3)
#
# The simplest starting point is to download the "Clustered Spectra as MGF" zip 
# file from GNPS and extract that into a folder to serve as the root directory for the dataset.
# antiSMASH and BiG-SCAPE output are then added as additional subfolders. 
#
# Typically all you will need to do is tell NPLinker where the root directory
# is located. Otherwise you can customise the locations of the individual elements
# using the various override settings below. 
#
# The layout is as follows (see the documentation for more details):
# <root>
#   |- strain_mappings.csv (strain ID mappings)
#   |   (METABOLOMICS DATA)
#   |- clusterinfo*/<UID>.tsv (spectrum metadata, NOTE: NPLinker will search any folder beginning with "clusterinfo")
#   |- metadata_table/metadata_table-00000.txt (only present in FBMN GNPS jobs?)
#   |- networkedges_selfloop/<UID>.selfloop (the "edges" file for spectra network)
#   |- spectra/*.mgf (mass spec data)
#   |- quantification_table_reformatted/<UID>.csv ("extra" spectrum metadata, only present in FBMN jobs? TODO proper name for this?)
#   |- DB_result/*.tsv (GNPS and other spectral annotation files, optional)
#   |- result_specnets_DB/*.tsv (GNPS and other spectral annotation files, optional)
#   |- DB_result/annotations.tsv (annotation data to extract from each file, see docs for details)
#   |- params.xml (optional, params.xml from GNPS job output)
#       (GENOMICS DATA)
#   |- antismash/*.gbk (antiSMASH GenBank files for the BGCs in the dataset)
#   |- bigscape/<classes subfolders> (BiG-SCAPE clustering/annotation files in their subfolders)
#       (MISC DATA)
#   |- description.txt (a freeform optional text file containing information about a dataset)
#   |- include_strains.csv (optional list of strain IDs to explicitly include when loading, others excluded)
#
# 2. Loading platform datasets
# ----------------------------
# Given a platform ID, NPLinker will retrieve the associated metabolomics data using the 
# GNPS task ID. By default, it will also attempt to retrieve any available 
# genomics data from the antiSMASH database using the RefSeq accession labels 
# in the platform project data. 
# 
# However, if you have local antismash results instead, you should also set the
# location of those files using the "antismash_dir" parameter in the 
# [dataset.overrides] section. NPLinker can optionally also run bigscape on 
# these results during the loading process. If you already have bigscape results
# you can additionally set the "bigscape_dir" parameter to the appropriate 
# location to skip this step (or simply place them inside the <root>/bigscape folder)
#
# All files are downloaded and extracted to locations inside ~/nplinker_data. On Windows
# this corresponds to C:\Users\<username>\nplinker_data.

# Dataset configuration settings
[dataset]
# If the dataset has the expected directory structure, this value is all that's required.
# It should be set to the path of the local directory containing the various data files
# described above.
# 
# If you want to load a dataset from the paired platform, the value should be a string
# of the form: "platform:datasetID". For example, "platform:MSV000079284" would 
# load the dataset with ID MSV000079284. 
root = "<root directory of dataset>"

# you can optionally set the BIGSCAPE clustering cutoff value here. the default value
# is 30, but any of the valid BIGSCAPE clustering thresholds can be used assuming the
# corresponding files exist in the dataset. Also note that it's possible to change this
# value after the dataset has initially been loaded, which will cause only the affected
# data to be reloaded. Possibly only useful for the webapp
#bigscape_cutoff = 30

# For datasets using the GNPS FBMN workflow, NPLinker can optionally try to parse
# more data out of the "metadata table" file included in the output. This can both
# simplify the process of creating a strain mappings file and allow NPLinker to 
# extract growth media labels for each strain, which are then displayed in the 
# web application. This option defaults to being disabled to provide a consistent
# experience with other types of dataset, but you can choose to enable it if you
# have a compatible metadata table file. 
#
# For more information: https://github.com/sdrogers/nplinker/wiki/Strain-mappings
#extended_metadata_table_parsing = false

[antismash]
# antismash file structure. Should be either 'default' or 'flat'. 
# default = the standard structure with nested subdirectories
# flat = all .gbk files placed in a single flat directory
# TODO: is "flat" required any more? 
antismash_format = "default"

# NPLinker needs to know how to parse antiSMASH filenames from BiG-SCAPE output
# to identify strain labels as part of the process of loading a dataset. 
# Since the format of the filenames can vary from dataset to dataset, there isn't
# a single rule that can be applied here. In most cases, the required action is
# "take all text up to the first occurrence of <character>", e.g. the first 
# underscore or period character. By default NPLinker will try the set of characters
# defined below in sequence until a match is found. If you need to override this
# then define a new list of at least one character to search for (note that it 
# doesn't need to be a single character, e.g. ".abc" would also work)
# antismash_delimiters = [".", "_", "-"]

# if using the Docker version of NPLinker which contains BiG-SCAPE and can run it
# automatically, you can choose to have the application automatically rename any
# files under the <root>/antismash folder which contain spaces in their filenames
# (both subfolders and .gbk files). This is to avoid BiG-SCAPE throwing up errors
# because it can't handle filenames with spaces in them. If you already have 
# BiG-SCAPE results or don't want NPLinker to rename anything automatically, set
# this to true instead
ignore_spaces = false

[docker]
# this optional section contains various settings that only apply to the dockerised 
# version of NPLinker. The Docker image contains BiG-SCAPE, and this tool can be run
# as part of the dataset loading process. If you want to enable/disable this, and
# configure the parameters used, this can be done by modifying the settings below.

# enable or disable running BiG-SCAPE on a dataset being used with the NPLinker Docker
# image. If false, you must have existing BiG-SCAPE results for your dataset in the
# format NPLinker expects (described above). If true, the copy of BiG-SCAPE installed
# in the Docker image will be run on the directory containing the antiSMASH data for
# the selected dataset, using the parameters configured below.
# The default value is true
run_bigscape = true

# The extra_bigscape_parameters setting allows you to configure the parameters passed
# to the BiG-SCAPE application when it's executed inside an NPLinker Docker image. In
# most cases you won't need to adjust this, but if you want extra control over
# the BiG-SCAPE run you can edit the default value to add/remove/change the supplied
# parameters.
#
# The available parameters are listed on the BiG-SCAPE wiki at:
#    https://git.wageningenur.nl/medema-group/BiG-SCAPE/-/wikis/parameters
#
# NPLinker will automatically configure the following parameter values so you
# never need to include them:
#   -i/--inputdir
#   -o/--outputdir
#   --pfam_dir
#
# NOTE: by default NPLinker will pass the "--mibig" parameter to BiG-SCAPE,
# including MiBIG BGCs in the analysis. If you do NOT want to include this, you
# will need to edit the default value and remove the "--mibig" section.
#
# Similarly, the "--clans-off" parameter is also passed by default. This disables
# the BiG-SCAPE feature which performs a second level of clustering on GCFs.
#
# For example, to use a different set of cutoffs and enable verbose mode while
# retaining the other defaults:
#   extra_bigscape_parameters = "--mibig --clans-off --cutoffs 0.3 0.4 0.5 -v"
#
# Or to do the same with MiBIG disabled:
#   extra_bigscape_parameters = "--clans-off --cutoffs 0.3 0.4 0.5 -v"
#
# Or to limit the number of cores used:
#   extra_bigscape_parameters = "--mibig --clans-off --cores 4"
#
# The default simply enables MiBIG (2.0), disables the extra GCF clustering step.
# Note that BiG-SCAPE defaults to using 0.3 as a clustering cutoff if "--cutoffs"
# is not set.
#extra_bigscape_parameters = "--mibig --clans-off"

# The Docker image also contains SIRIUS to run CANOPUS, and this tool can be run
# as part of the dataset loading process. If you want to enable/disable this, and
# configure the parameters used, this can be done by modifying the settings below.

# enable or disable running CANOPUS on a dataset being used with the NPLinker Docker
# image. If false, you should have CANOPUS results already present in the canopus
# directory if you want to use chemical class predictions from CANOPUS. If true,
# the copy of SIRIUS installed
# in the Docker image will be run on mgf file with the spectra data for
# the selected dataset, using the parameters configured below.
# The default value is false
# NOTE: if run_canopus is true but NPLinker is not run from the docker image,
# NPLinker also tries to look for SIRIUS in path.
run_canopus = false

# The extra_canopus_parameters setting allows you to configure the parameters passed
# to the SIRIUS when run within NPLinker. In most cases you won't need to adjust
# this, but if you want extra control over the SIRIUS/CANOPUS run you can edit
# the default value to add/remove/change the supplied parameters.
#
# The available parameters are listed on the SIRIUS documentation at:
#    https://boecker-lab.github.io/docs.sirius.github.io/cli/
#
# NPLinker will automatically configure the following parameter values so you
# never need to include them:
#   -i/--inputdir
#   -o/--outputdir
#
# NOTE: the "canopus" parameter should always be passed to SIRIUS, as this is
# responsible for running CANOPUS.
# NOTE: The --maxmz is an important parameter as it only runs for spectra below
# this mass cutoff. The default is 600 which will probably take at most a few hours
# for moderate datasets. If you want CANOPUS to finish within 24 hours, we
# recommend not setting this cutoff above 850 Da.
#
# The "formula zodiac structure" parameters are also passed by default.
# This runs the other normal features of SIIRUS to get the best CANOPUS predictions.
#
# For example, to use a different maxmz cutoff while using a different loggin level
# retaining the other defaults:
#   extra_canopus_parameters = "--maxmz 850 --log FINER formula zodiac structure canopus"
#
# Or to do the same with ZODIAC disabled:
#   extra_canopus_parameters = "--maxmz 850 --log FINER formula structure canopus"
#
# The default uses a --maxmz 600 cutoff, and uses formula zodiac structure canopus.
# Note that SIRIUS defaults to using infinity as a maxmz cutoff if "--maxmz"
# is not set.
extra_canopus_parameters = "--maxmz 600 formula zodiac structure canopus"

# this optional section contains various settings that only affect the webapp interface
# for NPLinker. If you're not using it, you can leave this out of your configuration. 
[webapp]
# A fundamental part of the webapp is a set of tables which display objects in the dataset
# that have been found to have links, based on the output of the Metcalf scoring method. 
# The value of this parameter is the minimum Metcalf score that a link must have for its
# associated objects to appear in the table. In other words, the higher this is set, the
# smaller the number of objects that will remain to be displayed in the tables. This may
# be useful for improving performance on larger datasets. 
# The default value is 2.0
tables_metcalf_threshold = 2.0

# a section for general scoring parameters (currently unused)
[scoring]

# the "Rosetta" scoring method involves some preprocessing steps that can take
# significant time. NPLinker will automatically run these steps as it loads the
# dataset and cache the results. if you would like to adjust the parameters used 
# by the Rosetta method you can do by setting them below (note that changing
# these values will invalidate any cached data and force the preprocessing steps
# to be run again)
