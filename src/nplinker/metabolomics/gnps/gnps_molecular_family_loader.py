    """Class to load molecular families from GNPS output file.

    The molecular family file is from GNPS output archive, as described below
    for each GNPS workflow type:

    1. METABOLOMICS-SNETS
        - networkedges_selfloop/*.pairsinfo
    2. METABOLOMICS-SNETS-V2
        - networkedges_selfloop/*.selfloop
    3. FEATURE-BASED-MOLECULAR-NETWORKING
        - networkedges_selfloop/*.selfloop

    The "ComponentIndex" column in the GNPS molecular family's file is treated
    as family id. But for molecular families that have only one member (i.e. spectrum),
    named singleton molecular families, their files have the same value of
    "-1" in the "ComponentIndex" column. To make the family id unique,the
    spectrum id plus a prefix `singleton-` is used as the family id of
    singleton molecular families.
