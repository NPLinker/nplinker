class BGC:
    def __init__(self, bgc_id: str, /, *product_prediction: str):
        """Class to model BGC (biosynthetic gene cluster) data.

        BGC data include both annotations and sequence data. This class is
        mainly designed to model the annotations or metadata.

        The raw BGC data is stored in GenBank format (.gbk). Additional
        `GenBank features`_ could be added to the GenBank file to annotate
        BGCs, e.g. antiSMASH has some self-defined features (like "region") in
        its output GenBank files.

        The annotations of BGC can be stored in JSON format, which is defined
        and used by MIBiG.

        Args:
            bgc_id: BGC identifier, e.g. MIBiG accession, GenBank accession.
            product_prediction: BGC's (predicted) natural products
                or product classes.

        Attributes:
            bgc_id: BGC identifier, e.g. MIBiG accession, GenBank accession.
            product_prediction: A tuple of (predicted) natural
                products or product classes of the BGC.
                For antiSMASH's GenBank data, the feature `region /product`
                gives product information.
                For MIBiG metadata, its biosynthetic class provides such info.
            mibig_bgc_class: A tuple of MIBiG biosynthetic
                classes to which the BGC belongs.
                Defaults to None.
                MIBiG defines 6 major biosynthetic classes for natural products,
                including "NRP", "Polyketide", "RiPP", "Terpene", "Saccharide"
                and "Alkaloid". Note that natural products created by all other
                biosynthetic mechanisms fall under the category "Other".
                More details see the publication: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40793-018-0318-y.
            description: Brief description of the BGC.
                Defaults to None.
            smiles: A tuple of SMILES formulas of the BGC's
                products.
                Defaults to None.
            antismash_file: The path to the antiSMASH GenBank file.
                Defaults to None.
            antismash_id: Identifier of the antiSMASH BGC, referring
                to the feature `VERSION` of GenBank file.
                Defaults to None.
            antismash_region: AntiSMASH BGC region number, referring
                to the feature `region` of GenBank file.
                Defaults to None.
            parents: The set of GCFs that contain the BGC.
            strain: The strain of the BGC.
