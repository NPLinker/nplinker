# The mode for preparing dataset.
# The available modes are "podp" and "local".
# "podp" mode is for using the PODP platform (https://pairedomicsdata.bioinformatics.nl/) to prepare the dataset.
# "local" mode is for preparing the dataset locally. So uers do not need to upload their data to the PODP platform.
# The value is required.

[log]
# Log level. The available levels are same as the levels in python package `logging`:
# "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL".
# The default value is "INFO".

# The log file to append log messages.
# The value is optional.

[mibig]
# Whether to use mibig metadta (json).

# The version of mibig metadata.
# Make sure using the same version of mibig in bigscape.

[bigscape]
# The parameters to use for running BiG-SCAPE.
# Version of BiG-SCAPE to run. Make sure to change the parameters property below as well
# when changing versions.
version = 1
# Required bigscape parameters are `--mix`, `--include_singletons` and `--cutoffs`. NPLinker needs
# them to run the analysis properly.
# Parameters that must NOT exist: `--inputdir`, `--outputdir`, `--pfam_dir`. NPLinker will
# automatically configure them.
# If parameter `--mibig` is set, make sure setting the config `mibig.to_use` to true and
# `mibig.version` to the version of mibig in bigscape.
# The default value is "--mibig --clans-off --mix --include_singletons --cutoffs 0.30".
parameters = "--mibig --clans-off --mix --include_singletons --cutoffs 0.30"
# for version 2, use the following parameters string:
# parameters = "--mibig_version 3.1 --include_singletons --gcf_cutoffs 0.30"
# Note that BiG-SCAPE v2 has subcommands. NPLinker requires the "cluster" subcommand and its parameters to be used. 
NPLinker will automatically set the following parameters: `--pfam_path`, `--inputdir` and `--outputdir`. So, do not set them here.
# BiG-SCPAPE v2 also runs a --mix analysis by default, and does not need this to be included.
# Which bigscape cutoff to use for NPLinker analysis.
# There might be multiple cutoffs in bigscape output.
# Note that this value must be a string.
# The default value is "0.30".

# Valid values are "metcalf" and "rosetta".
# The default value is "metcalf".
